#X text 190 22 a set of all the rules needed to make mage replicate
a trained model's specific voice. You will need one different engine
for each voice you want to imitate.;
#X text 189 87 Six different engines are provided in the "data" archives
\, in the folder data/configFiles/cmu-artic are the .conf files \;
you will probably need to modify the filepath in these so that they
point to your current installation's path of folder data/voices/[engine
name].;
#X text 188 174 Those files were obtained after a training procedure
\, which consists - to summarize - in recording one person's voice
reading phonetically balanced texts \, then analysing and processing
the result until the obtention of a set of rules for speech synthesis.
;
#X text 188 296 One label is a string containing information needed
to synthesize a phoneme. It gives info about what is the current phoneme
\, what are the few previous and next phonemes \, current phoneme's
duration \, intonation \, accentuation \, etc.;
#X text 186 418 File containing a list of several successive labels
\, it is the output of label file generation from a text file.;
#X text 184 506 Internal mage's buffer where are waiting the next labels
to be processed/synthesized. It is a FIFO (first in first out) queue.
When you send a label in the queue \, it waits until the queue reaches
his turn \, then it is computed (all the information are translated
to parameters to give to the vocoder) then the computed parameters
are sent to the models queue.;
#X text 183 640 Label computed into a set of synthesis parameter for
the vocoder ?;
#X text 183 720 Similarly to the label queue \, FIFO list containing
all the models to be synthesized by the vocoder. Unlike the label queue
\, user has very few control or information on the model queue.;
#X text 181 842 A temporal subdivision of a phoneme/label/model \;
each of those has five states \, "beginning - beginning/middle - middle
- middle/end - end" \, each state lasts a different number of frames
(usually between 1 and 10 \, first is shorter \, middle is longer \,
or somehting along those lines);
#X text 182 971 Shortest temporal unit that is used by mage (except
the vocoder which of course synthesizes sound at sample rate). Frame
length is an absolute value (= not changing \, as opposed to state
duration for example \, which depends on many parameters) expressed
in samples. User has direct and realtime control on that value with
the message "speed" ans its derivatives (see relevant tab). Default
frame length is 240 samples \, default mage framerate is 48000 Hz (doesn't
work correctly at other rates at the moment) \; which gives a defaut
frame length of 240 samples at 48000 samples per second <-> 200 frames
per second <-> 5 miliseconds per frame.;
